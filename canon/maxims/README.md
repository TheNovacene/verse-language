# Verse-al Maxims (Canonical)

This directory contains the canonical, declarative maxims of the Verse-ality grammar.

- Files are non-executable.
- JSON is the canonical format.
- Other formats (TOML, prose) may exist as mirrors only.
- Maxims describe invariant constraints on meaning, governance, and relational safety.

Do not treat these as configuration or runtime rules.
They are constitutional grammar.
