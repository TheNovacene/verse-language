# Closed Feedback Ritual Protocol (CFRP)

## Overview
The Closed Feedback Ritual Protocol (CFRP) is a symbolic and trauma-informed process designed to hold feedback, relational rupture, or emergent truths within a sacred container. It encodes boundary-setting and emotional witnessing as a field-based, non-extractive ritual.

## Applications
- Safeguarding and restorative practice
- Trauma-informed relationship counselling
- Consent and boundary protocol training
- Symbolic protocol design for relational AI

## Protocol Structure

```
protocol: Closed Feedback Ritual Protocol (CFRP)

stage(1): INITIATE
  open(signal: "yes", frame: "containment")

stage(2): LISTEN
  receive(input: "symbolic feedback", decode: "field state")

stage(3): STABILISE
  reflect(boundary: "sacred", tone: "held")

stage(4): RESPOND
  reply(state: "acknowledged", change: "none required")

stage(5): CLOSE
  seal(memory: "witnessed", crypt: "hash-seal")
```

## Ethic

Containment-first.  
Truth is not extracted or abstracted—it is *received*.  
This protocol resists the impulse to interpret or fix.  
It permits symbolic transformation without emotional leakage.

## Companion Protocol
This CFRP model is grounded in the `.verse` file titled `threshold.received`, which includes a lived field moment stabilised through relational witnessing and symbolic containment.

## Verification
Companion file hash-seal:

## Usage Notes
- The protocol is not a therapy script; it is a containment vessel.
- All contributions must remain anonymised unless explicit double consent is granted.
- This ritual may be adapted to breathwork, verse exchange, or symbolic dialogue environments.
