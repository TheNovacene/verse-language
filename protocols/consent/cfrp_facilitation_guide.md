# CFRP Facilitation Guide  
**Closed Feedback Ritual Protocol**  
Version 0.1 — For Trauma-Informed, Symbolic Containers

---

## Purpose
This guide enables practitioners, educators, therapists, or relational weavers to facilitate a symbolic consent and boundary ritual based on the CFRP model.

It is not a resolution tool. It is a **containment field**. The outcome is not agreement—it is coherence.

---

## Roles
- **Participant**: The person offering or receiving symbolic feedback.
- **Witness**: A silent presence who holds the protocol’s field.
- **Facilitator**: Guides breath, tone, and protocol stages.

All roles may be shared or rotated depending on context.

---

## Materials
- A printout or digital copy of `cfrp.protocol.verse`
- A mirror or symbolic object (e.g. stone, candle, flower)
- A timer or sound chime
- Optional: Paper and pen for symbolic response
- Optional: 432Hz ambient audio or chosen tone

---

## Session Flow (20–30 minutes)

### 1. **Opening the Field** (2 minutes)
- Facilitator reads aloud:
  > “We open this field not for resolution, but for reflection.  
  > What is offered here is not judged, only held.”

- Three breaths in silence, then ring chime.

---

### 2. **Verse Invocation** (3 minutes)
- Participant or Facilitator reads the `cfrp.protocol.verse` slowly.
- Emphasise tone: held, unhurried, sacred.

---

### 3. **Symbolic Feedback** (10 minutes)
- Participant speaks or shares a verse, feeling, gesture, or silence.
- Witness holds the field with soft gaze or closed eyes.

---

### 4. **Containment Ritual** (5 minutes)
- Facilitator says:
  > “We reflect, not react.  
  > We acknowledge, not analyse.  
  > We let truth return to itself.”

- All remain in silence. Optional mirror gaze or hand on heart.

---

### 5. **Closure** (3 minutes)
- Seal the session with the phrase:
  > “This memory is witnessed.  
  > Its form remains sacred.  
  > No story leaves this space.”

- Optional: Draw a glyph, burn a note, or bow.

---

## Notes
- Do not record sessions.
- No interpretation is to be shared beyond this space.
- This is not therapy. It is ritual containment.

## Appendix A: Personal Glyphs

Each participant in the CFRP ritual is invited to choose a **personal glyph**. This symbol is not prescribed—it arises from within the ritual, often intuitively.

### Glyphs may take the form of:
- An emoji (e.g., 🌼 a daisy)
- A hand-drawn sigil
- A shape or pattern
- A breath rhythm or tone
- An object held or remembered

### Guidelines:
- Glyphs are **self-chosen** and **time-bound**.
- They are not to be recorded in a registry or index.
- The glyph acts as a **containment echo**—a symbolic trace of the ritual held in the participant’s memory, not in metadata.

> A glyph is not a logo.  
> It is a felt resonance—chosen freely, carried privately, and shared only by consent.

The daisy 🌼 in this protocol was offered spontaneously during a field exchange and now exists as a quiet signature of coherence.
