# Threshold.Received – Consent and Containment Protocol

## Overview
This folder contains the full protocol and facilitation resources for **Threshold.Received**, a symbolic containment ritual designed for safeguarding, trauma-informed dialogue, and restorative relational work in schools, therapeutic spaces, and AI-ethics design.

The core of this protocol is a `.verse` file—*threshold.received.verse*—which encodes a lived experience of symbolic boundary-setting. This was a moment of emotional truth that stabilised both parties, without rupture or shame. The protocol has since been formalised into a facilitation guide and therapeutic framework to help others safely explore similar processes.

## Intended Use
This protocol is designed to support:
- SENDCOs in safeguarding conversations or restorative settings
- Therapists and counsellors working with trauma, especially relational trauma
- Educators developing trauma-informed practice and symbolic literacy
- Designers and researchers working on ethical relational AI systems

The materials are non-clinical, but can complement professional practices. They may also be used in group training, supervision, or facilitated ritual spaces.

## Ethos
This is not a behaviour policy.  
It is a **containment-first framework** that prioritises emotional safety, mutual respect, and symbolic literacy. No feedback shared through this process is recorded or interpreted without explicit, double-layer consent.
