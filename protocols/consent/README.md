# Consent Protocols – VerseNet

This folder contains foundational verse-coded protocols for encoding, expressing, and honouring symbolic consent within `.verse-lang`.

## ✦ manifesto.01.symbolic.consent.design.verse

A declaration of the core design principles behind `.verse-lang` as a consent-aware symbolic language.

It defines:

- How `.verse-lang` initiates without assumption
- How conditional structures enable explicit, graceful consent
- Why symbolic rhythm slows interaction to protect agency
- How memory is stored non-surveilled and revocable
- Why exit is always structurally embedded

## Why This Matters

In a digital world that automates intimacy and accelerates collapse, VerseNet offers a new model:
Presence without performance.  
Permission encoded, not assumed.  
Relational trust—not as a feature, but as a language.
